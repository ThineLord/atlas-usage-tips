# Atlas Usage Tips

## Overview
Atlas is a web browser built with ChatGPT integrated to help you accomplish tasks more effectively. This guide provides an overview of Atlas features and tips for getting the most from it.

## Getting Started
1. **Download and install**: Atlas is available for macOS (as of October 21, 2025). Download from the [ChatGPT website](https://chatgpt.com/atlas) and sign in with your ChatGPT account.
2. **Import settings**: When launching for the first time, you can import your bookmarks, saved passwords, and browsing history from your existing browser.
3. **New tab page**: The new tab page in Atlas includes a prompt bar where you can ask ChatGPT questions or enter URLs. Tabs for search, images, videos and news let you explore results.

## Key Features
- **ChatGPT in every tab**: Each tab has ChatGPT available. Type a question, paste a link or ask for a research summary right within the tab.
- **Context-aware assistant**: Atlas understands your current webpage and open tabs to provide relevant responses and suggestions. ChatGPT can remember context from sites you visit through browser memories.
- **Built‑in memory**: When browser memories are enabled, ChatGPT can remember pages you've visited, tasks you've started and ideas you've explored. You can view, archive or delete these memories at any time in Settings.
- **In-line writing help**: Atlas offers in-line assistance when writing emails, editing documents or filling forms. This eliminates the need to copy and paste between the browser and ChatGPT.
- **Natural language commands**: You can control Atlas using natural language—for example, "reopen the travel site from yesterday" or "close my recipe tabs." This helps manage tabs efficiently.
- **Agent mode (preview)**: Agent mode enables Atlas to perform tasks for you, such as researching, planning events or booking appointments while you browse. This feature is available to Plus, Pro and Business users.

## Usage Tips
- **Manage browser memories**: Memory is optional. You can enable/disable it per site using the visibility toggle in the address bar. To clear memories, go to Settings → Browsing History and delete entries. In incognito mode, ChatGPT does not record any memories or link chats to your account.
- **Search and find on page**: Click the address bar and type a query to search the web. Press `⌘ + F` (Mac) to search within the current page. To switch search engines, type the engine’s shortcut (e.g., `duckduckgo.com kittens`) or change the default in Settings.
- **Efficient tab management**: Use `⌘ + T` to open a new tab and `⌘ + W` to close the current tab. Press `Shift + ⌘ + T` to reopen the last closed tab. Switch tabs using `Control + Tab` / `Control + Shift + Tab`. Right-click a tab to pin or mute it.
- **Form autofill**: Atlas can save and autofill addresses, passwords and payment cards. Enable this in Settings → Web Browsing. Edit or remove saved entries as needed.
- **Downloads management**: Click a download link and a pop-up indicator appears in the bottom-right. Access downloaded files via the profile icon → Downloads. You can change the download location in Settings.
- **Switch between workspaces**: If you belong to multiple ChatGPT workspaces, click your profile in the top-right corner to switch. Each workspace has separate ChatGPT settings and memories.

## Best Practices
- **Privacy control**: You decide what ChatGPT can see and remember. Use incognito mode or toggle page visibility to limit data sharing.
- **Stay organized**: Leverage natural language commands and tab pinning to keep important pages accessible while avoiding clutter.
- **Utilize Agent mode responsibly**: When Agent mode is enabled, review tasks before confirming actions. Always verify details like dates, prices and personal information before completing bookings or purchases.
